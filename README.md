# AR Food Menu App
This project showcases an innovative Augmented Reality (AR) food menu application designed to elevate the dining experience in high-end restaurants. Developed using Unity, the Vuforia package, and AR Foundation, this app empowers customers to visualize dishes in stunning 3D before placing their orders.

# Benefits for Customers:

Intuitive AR Menu: Effortlessly access the complete menu by simply pointing your smartphone camera at a designated trigger image, typically a table marker placed strategically on the table. No more flipping through physical menus or deciphering cryptic descriptions.
Immersive 3D Food Previews: Say goodbye to flat, static photos and hello to lifelike 3D models of each dish. Rotate, zoom in, and examine the food from all angles to get a true sense of portion size, presentation, and the visual appeal that excites your taste buds.
Informed Decisions: Eliminate confusion when ordering. By visualizing the food in 3D, you can make informed choices based on your preferences and dietary needs. No more wondering about dish size or ingredient composition â€“ the AR experience clarifies everything beforehand.
Elevated Restaurant Experience: This app creates a novel and interactive dining experience. It adds a touch of excitement and engagement to the ordering process, allowing you to explore the menu in a more interactive way.
